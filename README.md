+ test cases.xlsx - test cases for chaincode
+ tests - terminal commands used to run tests
+ data - folder with a "real" data files
+ docker - folder with docker-compose files for distributed simulation and chaincode explorer (visual statistics tool for blockchain)
+ excelParser - python script for parsing files in "data" folder and adapting the data to the specific format
+ fabric - folder with Hyperledger fabric code. I uploaded it because I made some changes to the code code.
